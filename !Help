                                 Ext2Dir
                                 ~~~~~~~

   Purpose:  Turn xxx/y into y.xxx

   File extensions used by non RISC OS systems are normally mapped
   to  directories under RISC OS. To do that appropriate directories
   have to be created, files have to be copied to these directories
   and the file extensions have to be removed.
   Ext2Dir does that for you.


   Example:

   main/adb ------> creates a directory 'adb' and copies
                    the file into that directory.

   test/c   ------> creates a directory 'c' and copies
                           the file into that directory

   Ext2Dir is a command-line program but is supplied with a frontend
   (!Ext2Dir).
